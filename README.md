This is a repo showing a simple way to install an apk on some cursed android devices ex: Vtech devices

It is very simple to use, you just need to host the apk on a website (local or not) and when you load in the website you can either download an apk using the file.apk link under it or do a long press on the image then select the option to download it then launch the apk (you might need to enable apk sideloading)
